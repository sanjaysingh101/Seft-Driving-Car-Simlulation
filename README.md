# Seft-Driving-Car-Simlulation
Self Driving car simulation using Unity ML-Agents.<br>
SELF DRIVING VEHICLE SIMULATION USING NEURAL NETWORK AND GENETIC ALGORITHM<br>
<br>
This simulator is built on Unity 3D software. This Game engine is the core of this simulator development. Unity 3D is a multi-platform game development tool as well as a fully integrated game engine, which provides functions such as rendering engine, physics engine, scripting engine, lightmap, and scene management and supports these three programming languages C# .<br>
<br>
<br>
Unity 3D is utilized to incorporate the embedded designed car into the test situation while the carâ€™s movements and steering angle can serve as an examination premise. Options are available to choose sensors, monitor the output, and implement any autonomous driving, steering prediction, deep learning, and end-to-end learning algorithm.<br>
